# 0x07  Python - Test-driven development :

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:
  
* Whatâ€™s an interactive test
* Why tests are important
* How to write Docstrings to create tests
* How to write documentation for each module and function
* What are the basic option flags to create tests
* How to find edge cases

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that adds 2 integers.
1. Function that divides all elements of a matrix.
2. Function that prints My name is <first name> <last name>
3. Function that prints a square with the character #.
4. Function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and :
5. Unittests for the function def max_integer(list=[]):.
6. Function that multiplies 2 matrices:
7. Function that multiplies 2 matrices by using the module NumPy
8. Function that prints Python strings.
9. Class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)
10. Python class MagicClass
