# 0x05 Python - Exceptions :snake:

> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a “scripting language” for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers exceptions
At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:
  
* What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
* What are exceptions and how to use them
* When do we need to use exceptions
* How to correctly handle an exception
* What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
* How to raise a builtin exception
* When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that prints x elements of a list.
1. Function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().
2. Function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.
3. Function that divides 2 integers and prints the result.
4. Function that divides element by element 2 lists.
5. Function that raises a type exception.
6. Function that raises a name exception with a message.
7. Function that prints an integer.
8. Function that executes a function safely.
9. Function def magic_calculation(a, b):
10. Three C functions that print some basic info about Python lists, Python bytes an Python float objects. (Pending task)
